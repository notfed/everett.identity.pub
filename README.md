## Welcome to the Everett multiverse

### Motivation

- While in the Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics the universe evolves deterministically (according to the [SchrÃ¶dinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation)), observers see quantum randomness anyway.
- This is a visual aid to help understand how this occurs.
- You see, despite the multiverse as a whole being deterministic, if an observer performs a sequence of quantum coin flips, then, after each coin flip, the world branches (think "green=heads, tails=blue") into different worlds and therefore different observers who see different results, and, after a large number of coin flips, almost all observers will appear to have witnessed a sequence of random results unfold before their eyes. Again, this happens despite the multiverse being deterministic.

### What am I looking at?

- Each cell is a world.
- Each world branches (i.e., divides) into the worlds immediately below it, proportional to the supplied **Branch ratios**.
- You are `ð–¨†`. (Your cursor.)
- The vertical line is your history: i.e., the sequence of branches (and their corresponding colors) you have encountered.
- **Time** is how far down you are in the visualization: it's how many branches "you" have encountered.
- The **Frequency** counts how many times each color branch was encountered in your history.

### Tips

- Press **up** and **down** to adjust the time.
- Move the mouse horizontally to adjust where "you" are, vertically to adjust the time.
- Drag the red walls in row 1 to adjust branch ratios
- Press **right arrow** to add a new branch
- Press **left arrow** to remove a branch

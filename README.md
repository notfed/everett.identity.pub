### Motivation

The [many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation) says that the universe is deterministic: i.e., it obeys [the Schr√∂dinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation).

So how do we end up with random numbers, for example with [quantum coin flips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_coin_flipping)? Well, to put it simply, many-worlds says that there's a world where you see heads and a world where you see tails, resulting in an illusion of randomness. This tool is a simulation to help develop an intuition for how this works.

The key takeaway is that, for almost every possible "you," the measured outcomes converge to 50% heads and 50% tails as you collect more samples. Try slowly dragging from the top to prove to yourself that it's actually counting correctly.

### What am I looking at?

- Cells represent worlds
- Each world branches into two worlds just below it:
    - A green world, representing heads
    - A blue world, representing tails
- You are `ñ®Ü`. (Your cursor.)
- The vertical line is your past: it intersects with the sequence of coin flips you've measured
- "Your measurements" shows the counts and averages of the coin flips you've measured

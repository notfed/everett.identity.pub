### Motivation

The [many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation) says that the universe evolves deterministically according to the [Schr√∂dinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation).

So where does [quantum randomness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse) come from? Well, to put it simply, many-worlds says that this "randomness" is an illusion due to there being multiple versions of "you". This is a visual aid to help you see that for yourself.

### What am I looking at?

- Cells represent worlds
- Each world branches (i.e., divides) into two worlds just below it:
    - A green world, representing heads
    - A blue world, representing tails
- You are `ñ®Ü`. (Your cursor.)
- The vertical line, or "history", represents the sequence of coin flips you've observed
- The "stats" area averages your sequence of coin flips

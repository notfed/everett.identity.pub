### Motivation

The [many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation) says that the universe is, and only is, a vector in Hilbert space evolving deterministically according to the [Schr√∂dinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation).

So why does quantum mechanics give us random numbers, e.g. with a [quantum coin flip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_coin_flipping)? Well, to put it simply, many-worlds says that this "randomness" is an illusion, and that actually, for each coin flip, the world branches into two worlds: one where you see a "heads", and one where you see a "tails".

### What am I looking at?

- Cells represent worlds
- Each world branches into two worlds just below it:
    - A green world, representing heads
    - A blue world, representing tails
- You are `ñ®Ü`. (Your cursor.)
- The vertical line, or "history", represents the sequence of coin flips you've observed
- The "stats" area averages your sequence of coin flips
